# Geometric Forms Visualization

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to visualize and analyze basic geometric shapes using Python. It's ideal for students, educators, and enthusiasts who want to understand geometry through code and visualization.

## Features

- Plotting geometric shapes using `matplotlib`
- Use of `numpy` for precise point generation and transformation
- Visual demonstration of:
  - Circles
  - Ellipses
  - Rectangles
  - Polygons
- Customization of shape parameters (size, color, position)
- Code written for clarity and educational use

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
