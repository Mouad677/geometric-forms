# geometric-forms
This project provides a visual and mathematical exploration of basic geometric forms using Python's matplotlib and numpy libraries. It demonstrates how to plot and manipulate shapes like circles, ellipses, rectangles, and polygons interactively in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Ideal for learners in math, geometry, or data visualization.
